Feature: Bulk deletion of users in User Management

  Scenario: Verify the system allows deleting multiple users at once
    Given I am logged in as an admin
    When I navigate to the "User Management" module
    And I select multiple users from the "Users" list
    And I click the "Delete" button
    And I confirm the deletion
    Then all selected users should be deleted
    And the "Users" list should be updated to reflect the changes
