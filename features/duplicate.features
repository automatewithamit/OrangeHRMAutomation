Feature: Prevent duplicate usernames in User Management

  Scenario: Verify the system prevents adding a user with an existing username
    Given I am logged in as an admin
    When I navigate to the "User Management" module
    And I click the "Add User" button
    And I fill in all required fields with an existing username
    And I click "Save"
    Then an error message "Username already exists" should be displayed
    And the user should not be added to the system
