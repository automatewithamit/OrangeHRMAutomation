Feature: Restrict editing multiple users in User Management

  Scenario: Verify the system prevents editing multiple users at once
    Given I am logged in as an admin
    When I navigate to the "User Management" module
    And I select multiple users from the "Users" list
    And I click the "Edit" button
    Then the system should prevent editing multiple users at once
    And an error message or warning should be displayed indicating that only one user can be edited at a time
